# 2023-Calculator-Challenge

## Date of Assignment - 04/11/23

### Challenge Information:

In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a calculator with a language of your choice! Said program will need to take in user input and make use of arithmetic operators or Math functions to calculate end values. While there is no scoring system, we will "critique" your code by next meeting. Kind words and constructive suggestions ONLY!

### Repository Information:

Hello, and welcome to the 2023-Calculator-Challenge GitHub repository! Here scribes will record your code to display during club meetings and show off your progress. Don't worry too much about the deadline as depending upon workload we expect some late submissions. If you have questions about how to best create your calculator, don't be afraid to reach out and ask questions; we're happy to help! Remember to have fun!!

### Branch by Matthew Bender
This is a graphing calculator that is meant to be able to accept a wide variety of input, including constants such as 'pi' and functions like 'log'.
It does not have strong error handling, and broken input might result in a crash or the line being made of '?'.
There are three characters used to graph the line:
        '?' indicates that there was an error, likely division by 0, it mainly represents asymptotes and holes
        'X' indicates the y value of the exact (integer) x value
        'x' indicates the y value of a similar y value
        
Example:
  x
  x
  X
   X
    X
     ?
----|---
the lowercase x's help draw the line, but the uppercase X shows what y at x = 3 is.
